Something 2 Wear
----

Overview:
----
For Project 2 I created a full stack application using (M)Mongoose,(E)Express,(H)HandleBars, and (N)Node.

Inspiration:
----
I always feel that I have nothing to wear when I have hundreds of clothes. I will sometimes forget I have a clothing item and purchase something similar. I created this app for women and men who could use a bit more organization. The app makes it easy to go through your closet anywhere at anytime.  



Technologies Used:
----
HTML5

Express 

Node.js - framework.

MongoDB - Database.

Mongoose - Connections

Bootstrap - Styling.

CSS3 - Styling.

HandleBars.js



Wireframes:
----
Here are my wireframes for FootUp intended for use on a mobile phone. They are quite detailed, have a lot of wishful features, and many are not included on the app. They may be added in the future!
