#Something 2 Wear

##Inspiration
I always feel that I have nothing to wear when I have hundreds of clothes. I will sometimes forget I have a clothing item and purchase something similar. I created this app for women and men who could use a bit more organization. The app makes it easy to go through your closet anywhere at anytime.  


##User Stories
Users have a way to organize and communicate a game with a “create game feature”

If you need people to play with or don't know of a location where soccer is being played a “join game feature” will be needed.

Know more about other users before joining a game (such as age, sex, picture, name, etc.) with “user profiles”.

Finding the location of a game with a “map feature”.

Build it responsive so that it can be used on a mobile phone.


##Technologies Used:

Express 

Node.js - framework.

MongoDB - Database.

Mongoose - Connections

Bootstrap - Styling.

CSS3 - Styling.

HandleBars.js



##Wireframes 
Here are my wireframes for FootUp intended for use on a mobile phone. They are quite detailed, have a lot of wishful features, and many are not included on the app. They may be added in the future!
